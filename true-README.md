## Welcome

[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) has recently initiated what's known as the **I**nternal **S**cientist **F**unding **M**odel (ISFM) â€“ an infrastructure intended to provide sustained support for certain core governmental scientific efforts involving NASA scientists. This repository holds the [webpage](ames-exobiology.github.io) where you can find the latest goals, presentations, papers, and more from some of [NASA's Exobiology Branch](https://www.nasa.gov/content/exobiology-branch-code-ssx) ISFM working groups.
