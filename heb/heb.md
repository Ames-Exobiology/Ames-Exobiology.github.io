## Overview
The Habitable Environments and Biosignatures (HEB) group is focused on the following areas:

1. **Early Earth**
	- Biogeochemical contexts of biosignatures (Dave Des Marais and Linda Jahnke)
2. **Mars**
	- Factors influencing the habitability of Fe-rich systems on Mars (Tom Bristow)
	- The dry limit of habitability (Alfonso Davila)
3. **Ocean Worlds**
	- Energy flux constraints on biological and biosignature potential for ocean worlds (Tori Hoehler)
4. **Exoplanets**
	- Light intensity limits for oxygenic photosynthesis and the detectability of photosynthetic biospheres on exoplanets (Owen Lehmer)
	- Remotely detectable photosynthetic biosignatures (Niki Parenteau)
